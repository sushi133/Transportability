This is the repository for the project work for Bios6624. In this course I will complete 5 projects (Regression Analysis, Bayesian Regression, Study Design and Grant Writing, Survival Analysis and Simulation). Each project is contained in a single subfolder. Each of these subfolders have the same folder structure described below. 

Details about the folder structure for a project:
